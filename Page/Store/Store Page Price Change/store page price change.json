        the format of each line is a search text and a replacement text or
        replacement text function
        
        if the text has single quotes in them then put a backslash before
        the single quotes. example: it's becomes it\'s
        
        search text can be a string or a regular expression, backslashes
        need to be escaped in regular expressions
        
        replacement text can use regular expression grouping syntax when the
        search text is a regular expression
        
        replacement text functions need to accept node, isDetail, text, and
        searchText parameters. the function must return replacement text or a
        boolean. true tells the code to continue to the next search/replace
        pair without making the replacement. false means skip all further
        replacements. your function needs to be defined before this code runs
        
        following are example lines. copy an example line below and paste
        after the example lines. remove '// ' at beginning of pasted line.
        repeat for as many times as needed
