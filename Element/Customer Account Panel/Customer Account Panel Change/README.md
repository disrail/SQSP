---

## Quick Install

* Add code from file **[customer account panel change.html][4]** to Website >
  Pages > Website Tools > Code Injection > FOOTER. Please see [Add code to code
  injection][5]. Read the code for any instructions within.

## Classes

Squarespace includes virtually no semantic class names for the Customer Account
panel element. This code attempts to add some useful classes.

  * twc-capc-account-settings
  * twc-capc-addresses
  * twc-capc-close
  * twc-capc-greeting
  * twc-capc-greeting-sign-out
  * twc-capc-header
  * twc-capc-orders
  * twc-capc-profile
  * twc-capc-search
  * twc-capc-sign-out
  * twc-capc-title

If you use SS dynamically generated class names, the ones that look like a
string of gibberish, your code will most likely break pretty quickly. My code is
not immune to breakage but I think my method will break at a slower rate.

## Callbacks

You can optionally add [callback][6] functions to further customize the
processing of the account panel.

Your callbacks must accept a document element and string parameter.

Following is example code. Place your callbacks before the customer account
panel change code. Note the use of var.

```html
<script>

  var twcCapcLog = ( dcmnt, panelType ) => {
  
    console.log ( 'twcCapc dcmnt : ', dcmnt );
    
    console.log ( 'twcCapc panelType : ', panelType );
    
    }
    
  </script>

```

Then in the customer account panel change code set callbacks per the
instructions in the code.
